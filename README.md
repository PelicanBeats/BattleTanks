Hi my name is Martin and i'm Learning how to game design in C++/Unreal to creating small fun games as a hobby to build up experiance with C++/Unreal in order to take a new direction in my life with a new and exciting career. 

# BattleTanks
An open-world filled with terrain and building obsticales around the map to create fun and intresting gameplay to keep the player on his or hers toes at all times.
Going to have advanced controls so player can have a wide control over their tank on the battlefield.
